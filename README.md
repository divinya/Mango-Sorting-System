# Smart Mango Sorting System

## Overview
The **Smart Mango Sorting System** is an automation system designed to sort mangoes based on their ripeness using sensor technology. The system utilizes color sensors to detect the ripeness of mangoes, classifying them into different categories. This project is built using Arduino, making it a great example of real-world automation and hardware interaction.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Uno** or any compatible board
- **TCS3200 Color Sensor**: To detect mango ripeness
- **Servo Motor**: For sorting mangoes based on color
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**
- **Power Supply**: 5V power adapter for Arduino
- **Mango Sorting Tray**: Custom setup for placing mangoes and sorting them

## Software Setup
1. Install the **Arduino IDE** from the official website: [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Open `mango_sorting.ino` in Arduino IDE.
4. Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
5. Select the correct board and port from the **Tools** menu.
6. Upload the code to the Arduino by clicking the upload button in the Arduino IDE.

## Usage Instructions
1. Place the mangoes on the sorting tray.
2. The system will automatically detect the ripeness of each mango using the color sensor.
3. Based on the detected color, the servo motor will sort the mangoes into different trays.
